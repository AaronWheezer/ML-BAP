The aim of the thesis was to examine the influence of AI in the modern world, particularly in
the field of supply chain management. This thesis was also aimed to identify how AI can be
applied in supply chain management. The qualitative research method (document analysis) was
used for the research.

AI can streamline every aspect from demand to inventory to supply with minimal human
involvement. It is also effective in precision planning which will make the supply chain
management processes reliable. The role of AI is admirable in logistics, as it is making the
transport faster than before

in the system. The automation of warehouses is the key to the success for the effectiveness of
supply chain management
